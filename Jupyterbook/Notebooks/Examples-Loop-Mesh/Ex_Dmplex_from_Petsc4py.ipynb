    "The purpose of this notebook is to provide a tutorial for the DMPlex features in PETSc. DMPlex and its sub-objects are an attempt to properly abstract out the concept of grids and the assignment of degree of freedom information to entities in that grid. The hope is that this will allow for easy implementation of different discretization ideas and subsequently lead to their fair comparison. To be able to use DMPlex you need to speak its language and understand how to get the information your methods need. In this tutorial I will explain and demonstrate the functionality of the DMPlex API."

    "The transitive closure of a point in the DMPlex is a list of all reachable points from the given point, by default in the 'in-edge' direction. The transitive closure is then a set created by recursively taking the union on all points in the cone and its cones. In other words, it is all points of lower or equal dimension that this point can \"reach\". The routine also returns an array parallel to the closure array which defines how the points are oriented relative to the give point (e.g. for a cell, you might need to flip some edges to follow a right-handed convention). There is a flag in the routine, useCone, which if set to False will perform the same operation but in the 'out-edge' direction (that is, instead of recursively operating on cones, it will use the supports)."
